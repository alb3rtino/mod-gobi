 * [MODGOBI-2](https://issues.folio.org/browse/MODGOBI-2)
 * Added the GOBI `PurchaseOrder.xsd` for validation and code generation.
   Currently, we cannot use the XSD file in the RAML file due to RMB using
   a JSON unmarshaller instead of XML. The "model" code was generated by RMB
   and moved into a permanent package.
 * Initial work
